I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student supervised by Dr. [Tyler Derr](https://tylersnetwork.github.io/) at Vanderbilt University. I am enchanted by general high tech and artificial intelligence with a keen interest in graph neural networks, as well as its applications in natural language processing and recommender systems. 

I was named as a [Russell G. Hamilton Scholar](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/gli/russell-g-hamilton/) by Vanderbilt University, and I thankfully received the [Engineering Graduate Fellowship](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/funding/) and [Deanâ€™s Graduate Fellowship](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/funding/university_scholarships.php).

Prior to joining Vanderbilt, I completed the computer science undergraduate curriculum at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities from Sep. 2020 to May 2022 (GPA: 4.0/4.0, Honor: Distinction). During that time, I also finished multiple research projects and a summer internship.
